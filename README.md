# dat.exe-round-9999-real.exe.avi.mp4.yourmom
this is basically something to mock common exe games on scratch. this is 100% ironic.

since this is the github release, not only you get the real game. you also get the source code. pretty cool right?

WARNING: there is some strong language and a sexual joke in this game. if you don't really like that type of stuff. play the scratch verison: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/423802758/

enjoy i guess
